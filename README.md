# peerChat
## A peerJS chat
A simple chat using [peer.js](http://peerjs.com/). 

My intent with this project is just to learn how to create a p2p connection. Later, i will try to make a multiplayer game out of it.

## Usage
When you enter, you will receive a unique ID, send this ID to your friend and get his ID. 

Start chatting =)

Try a [live demo](http://mariohd.github.io/peerChat).
