# peerChat
A peerJS chat
================
A simple chat using [peer.js](http://peerjs.com/). 

My intent with this project is just to learn how to create a p2p connection. Later, i will try to make a multiplayer game out of it.

Thanks to [Lucas Bebber](http://tympanus.net/Development/CreativeGooeyEffects/) for his design.
